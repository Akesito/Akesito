## Achivements

These are some of my achivements in life that i cherrish the most and helped me grow as a individual

- First Robotics - I participaed on the First Robotics Competitions back in High School. We managed to get to the World Championship. But eventhough we new we would not get very far we tried to ake advantage of the situation and meet all sorts of new people from all around the globe. Also for that competition i had to learn how to work with a lot of people. Overall it was a fantastic experience.
- Videogame Career - As i was growing i was very interested on competitions and tournaments for the videogames i enjoyed. I managed to get to some teams and really tired my best go get to the top. But because of some situations at some very bad times i could not progress as i intended to. Nontheless i learned a lot from playing competitively. Being a good teammate and sometimes a good leader takes practice and a very good mindset. And i managed to absorbe a lot of experience working with all sorts of people arround me at that time. 
- Programming progress - Although i had not had the time or the courage to start proyects of my own big enought to fulfill my desire im trying my best. I have a lot of proyects on mind that i really want to make them. But right now i feel that i have to progress a little bit more and get more knowledge in order to continue forward.
